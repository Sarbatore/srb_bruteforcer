# Hash Name Discovery Tool for RedM
A generic brute-force script for RedM that helps you reverse-engineer hash values by testing thousands of potential name combinations. Whether you're trying to uncover door names, slot IDs, component names, or weapon identifiers and some other hashes ‚Äî this tool is for you.

## üìå Disclaimer
This tool is for educational and development purposes. Brute-force testing too many strings without control can impact game performance ‚Äî use batching and wait times responsibly.

## üí° What It Does
* üîÅ Generates permutations of strings using custom prefixes, dictionary words, and suffixes.
* üîê Computes the hash (joaat) for each combination and compares it against a list of existing hashes (retrieved in-game).
* Skips already-known names using a JSON file.
* Logs and returns all valid newly discovered names.

## üß† Why Use This?
This tool is ideal when:
* You have a numeric hash but not the original string.
* You're trying to uncover hidden content, internal references, or undocumented asset names.
* You're automating the process of guessing asset strings without trial-and-error by hand.

## üß© Parameters
| Parameter            | Type     | Description                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dictionary`         | `table`  | List of base words to use for combination.                                 |
| `prefixes`           | `table`  | List of string prefixes (e.g. `"DOOR_VAL_"`, `"SLOTID_"`, etc.).           |
| `suffixes`           | `table`  | List of string suffixes (e.g. `"_01"`, `"_L"`).                            |
| `maxWords`           | `number` | Max number of dictionary words to combine.                                 |
| `existingHashes`     | `table`  | List of known hashes (numeric) collected in-game.                          |
| `knownNamesJsonPath` | `string` | Path to a JSON file containing already discovered names to avoid reprints. |

```lua
local existingHashes = {
    2978933597,
    4264525338,
    183181940,
}
local dictionary = {
    "gunsmith",
    "train",
    "prison",
    "stable",

    "int",
    "ext",
    
    "front",
    "back",
    "middle",
    "exit",
}
local prefixes = {
    "DOOR_ABE_",
    "DOOR_VAL_",
    "DOOR_ANN_",

    }
local suffixes = {
    "",
    "_01",

local newFound, notFounds = BruteForce(dictionary, prefixes, suffixes, maxWords, existingHashes, knownNamesJsonPath)
```
